# Polynomial Calculator

A calculator that creates, adds, multiplies polynomials in Java by manipulating linked lists to determine and display results.

In order to test, you must create a .txt file with a list of coefficients followed by the degree of the term.
For example,

1 4

2 3

3 2

4 1

5 0

would create the polynomial: x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x + 5.
